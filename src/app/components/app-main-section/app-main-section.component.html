		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			Mahendra Singh Dhoni (About this soundpronunciation (help·info) born 7 July 1981), is an
Indian international cricketer who captained the Indian national team in limited-overs formats
from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He is the only captain in the history of 
Cricket to win all ICC trophies. Under his captaincy, India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 
2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. A 
right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in 
One Day Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is considered an effective 
"finisher" in limited-overs formats. He is also regarded by some as one of the best 
wicket-keepers and captains in modern limited-overs international cricket.

			He made his ODI debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka. Dhoni has been the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of 
the Year award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel 
Ratna award in 2007, the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009 and the 
Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour, in 2018.[6] He was named as the captain of 
the ICC World Test XI in 2009, 2010 and 2013. He has also been selected a record 8 times in ICC 
World ODI XI teams, 5 times as captain. The Indian Territorial Army conferred the honorary rank 
of Lieutenant Colonel[7] to Dhoni on 1 November 2011. He is the second Indian cricketer after 
Kapil Dev to receive this honour.

		<h3>Playing Style</h3>
		<p>
			Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. He is an unorthodox batsman in the sense that much of his batting technique defies the coaching manuals. Dhoni doesn't have a great footwork. He believes in muscling a full ball to Long-on, Long-off or Midwicket regions rather than driving it to the Cover region. Not only a smasher of the full length balls, he also is a firm puller and hooker of the short balls, which makes it tough for the bowler to bowl to him. He holds the bat firmly at the bottom of the handle and tries to hit the ball hard and flat to clear the boundary. Yet, he manages to hit long sixes at times.
		</p>
		<p>
			Initially, Dhoni appeared as a lower-order attacking batsman but he gradually changed his playing style to deal with high-pressure scenarios and his growing responsibility as a captain. He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets.[149] He made use of the helicopter shot technique,[150] taught to him by a fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal.
		</p>
		<p>
			His wicket-keeping skill is widely praised by cricket experts but also criticised for lack of good technique.[153][154] He has a world record for the highest number of stumpings by any wicket-keeper.[155]

As a captain Dhoni was approachable to players.[156] Former cricketers and opposition players underline that his behaviour on Cricket ground was calmed and composed. He used to allow bowlers to set field for themselves

		<h3>Dhoni's Quote</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The process is more important than the results. And if you take care of the process, you will get the results</li>
			<li>A loss makes you humble. It tests the other batsmen and bowlers. Also, if you keep winning you don't now what area you need to work on.</li>
			<li>Listen to your elder’s advice not because they are always right, but because they have more experience of being wrong.</li>
